<p>MCT stands for “medium chain triglyceride” which is made up of medium-length chains of saturated fatty acids from coconut flesh called triglycerides.</p>

<h2>Why is it the best carrier oil</h2>

<p>The reason we use MCT oil is that in comparison to other carrier oils that get commonly used with cannabis/cannabinoid/CBD extracts, MCT is more easily absorbed by the body. This is because MCT’s are lipid molecules that are more readily absorbed and oxidized than most lipids. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3351702" target="blank">Research has found</a> that absorption improves the older we get.</p>

<p>MCT improves the absorption (bioavailability) of CBD because whole-plant CBD extract is fat-soluble, meaning CBD dissolves into <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18296368" target="blank">fatty medium-chain triglycerides</a>, and synchronizes with your system as soon as it passes through the digestive tract. MCTs travel straight from the gut to the liver and do not require bile to be broken down as longer-chain fatty acids do.</p>

<p>This is what makes MCT oil the most efficient way to consume <a href="{{site.url}}/store/health-wellness/>full spectrum CBD oil</a>, because it causes cannabinoids to be absorbed faster and interact with the body quickly and easily.</p>

<h2>Why is This Important?</h2>

<p>Cannabinoids break down, and they are stored in fat versus water (lipid soluble), so are best consumed with fat to increase absorption. When ingested around 70% of CBD and other cannabinoids are broken down in your liver by a process called First Pass Metabolism when not taken with MCT.</p>

<p>The liver sees the MCT fats as carbs and directly metabolizes the fats into energy. It does this without causing free-radicals because the liver still processes it as fat. This rapid metabolism also puts the cannabinoids to use right away. All of the potential benefits of MCTs complement what studies, research and self-made testimonials are starting to show us about CBD.</p>

<p>The effects of our Whole-Plant CBD delivered in MCT are quick acting and long lasting. The improved health benefits of delivering the oil sublingually (mucosal) will increase benefits for longer throughout the day. When the holistic effects of MCT get combined with the therapeutic benefits of CBD, users experience the full range of health benefits that CBD oils have to offer.</p>

<h2>MCT for brain related conditions</h2>

<p>Studies have shown <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1474442217304088" target="blank">MCT oil may improve brain function</a> in moderately physically healthy people, which has shown could have benefits for people with epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease and autism. Taken as part of a ketogenic diet may help manage conditions such as epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and autism.</p>

<p>Why they may be beneficial in managing epilepsy. One <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3625124/" target="blank">study showed</a> that the MCT capric acid improved seizure control better than a widespread anti-epileptic drug.  Another additional study found that the same MCT blocked receptors in the brain that cause seizures, though more human studies are needed.</p>

<p>One study found that a single dose of MCTs improved short-term cognition in 20 people with <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15123336" target="blank">Alzheimer’s disease</a> with a certain gene type, namely APOE ɛ4-negative. The study had 20 subjects with AD or mild cognitive impairment consume a drink containing emulsified MCTs or placebo and recorded the results for both subject group.</p>

<p>MCT has also shown it can improve behavior in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In this study 15 children ages 2 to 17 years where given supplemental MCT for 3 months. Benefits of MCT for weight loss and athletes and exercise.</p>

<h2>Benefites of MTC for weight management</h2>

<p>MCT oil can increase fat burning and reduce the need for carbs during exercise. Clinical studies have reported that MCT may reduce lactate buildup in athletes and assist the use fat for energy. One such study reported that athletes who took 6 grams/1.5 teaspoons/1.5 ml of MCTs with food before exercise had lower lactate levels and also found it exercise easier, compared to those taking <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19436137" target="blank">LCTs</a>.</p>

<p>MCTs have been shown to have antimicrobial, antibacterial and antifungal effects. The studies show that MCT contains powerful fatty acids that fight yeast and bacterial growth. One such study showed the reduction in the growth of Candida albicans by 25%. This is a common yeast that can cause thrush and various common skin infections, and that MCTs themselves have also been shown to suppress the growth of widespread infectious fungus in hospitals by up to 50%. (sources: 1, 2, 3)</p>

<p>harmful bacteria such as streptococcus, staphylococcus, neisseria and other bacteria known to cause viruses have been killed by MCTs. Your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl34gvzsw1g" target="blank">gut health and micobiota</a> affects everything from energy expenditure to our ability to absorb vitamins and minerals, so it’s important to keep it balanced and healthy.</p>

<h2>May Reduce Risk Factors for Heart Disease associated with Weight and Cholesterol</h2>

<p>MCT oil may reduce heart disease risk factors such as weight, cholesterol and inflammation. Adding it to your diet could help lower your risk of heart disease.</p>

<p>A study of 24 overweight men found that taking MCT oil combined with phytosterols and flaxseed oil for 29 days <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/13-foods-that-lower-cholesterol-levels" tartget="blank">reduced total cholesterol</a> by 12.5%. However, when olive oil was used instead, the reduction was only 4.7%.</p>

<p>The same study also found better reductions in LDL or “bad” cholesterol when the MCT oil mixture was added to their diet.</p>

<p>MCT oil may help manage diabetes by reducing fat storage and increasing fat burning. It may also help you control your blood sugar. </p>

<p>A small study based in China, studied 40 people with diabetes and found that the participants who consumed MCT oil daily had significant reductions in body weight, waist circumference and insulin resistance, compared to those taking corn oil containing LCTs.</p>

<p>Another study found that when 10 people with diabetes were injected with insulin, they needed 30% less sugar to maintain normal blood sugar levels when they consumed MCTs. </p>

<p>The small size of the carbon molecules in MCT oil also increases its solubility in biological fluids such as blood.</p>

<p>As you can see, the compelling research and findings show that not only in MCT the perfect match for CBD and the perfect protective carrier for Cannabinoid delivery, has many health beneficial properties, but MCT’s also help keep a healthy balance of gut flora and improve the absorb-ability of nutrients and other compounds.</p>
