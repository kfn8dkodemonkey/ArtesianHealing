<h2>Genetics:</h2>

<p>DC Haze x ERB – Hybrid</p>

<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>A real head turner is Suver haze, with fresh mixed greens from light to dark, a hint of yellowish sun-kissed hay. Well trimmed, reasonably tight and dense buds, packed with crystals, a plethora of trichomes, and plentiful orange pistils. Well trimmed, not overly dense, on the smaller side, but that doesn’t detract from its quality. The product photos are of the actual batch on sale; some variations will occur.</p>

<h2>Smell</h2>
<p>Some say Suver is subtle, but we find the aroma of this one to be unmistakable, loud, and delightfully intoxicating. It’s sophisticated yet, fresh, skunky, sweet, fruity, and spicy all at once. She’s one for the connoisseur that hides within us.</p>

<h2>Taste</h2>

<p>Suver Haze flower tastes similar to its aromatic characteristics, complex, deep, earthy, woody, citrus/pine/skunky, with notes of Papaya. Smooth on the throat and lungs when consumed. Enjoyable, Moorish, and an absolute delight.</p>

<h2>Effects</h2>

<p>Due to its potency, rich terpene, and cannabinoid profile, Suver is comforting, soothing, demanding relaxation and sleep. If you’re looking for that full-body medicating, calmness. Suver Haze is one for you.</p>
