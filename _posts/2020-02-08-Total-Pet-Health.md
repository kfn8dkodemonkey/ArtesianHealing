<p>We take absolute pride in producing our 100% natural 500mg of beautifully created Full Spectrum CBD oil. Our top-quality full spectrum CBD oil contain not only a high amounts of CBD, but other naturally-occurring cannabinoids and terpenes from the cannabis/hemp plant, providing all the benefits without the high.</p>

<p>We believe that your pets deserve the exact same standards, quality and formula used for our “human” pharmaceutical grade CBD oil. Our pets are as important to us all as our family members and as such should be given only the best quality health products. So, that’s what we do. Why downgrade our products to save a few $, and give second grade products to our beloved pets?</p>

<p>We also decided it is counter productive and more expensive to consumers overall if we reduced the potency just to give our pets more drops each day. Why give 5 drops of 100mg oil to your pet, when 1 drop of 500mg is the same, cheaper and easier to administer.</p>

<p>With an average of 600 drops in each bottle, giving your pet 1 to 4 drops per day, this bottle will last up to 5 months or more.</p>

<p>We use <a href="{{site.urel}}/blog/mtc-oil">MCT oil</a> (fractionated Coconut oil) as the carrier for additional health benefits for pets as well as increasing CBD absorption rates. Only the best ingredients make it into our unique formula.</p>

<h2>Why MTC is good for your pets.</h2>
