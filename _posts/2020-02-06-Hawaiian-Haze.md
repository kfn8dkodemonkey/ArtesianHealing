<p>Mixed greens from light to dark, teal & with the occasional purple. Frosty with an abundance of cream-colored trichomes with plentiful red/brownish pistils. The product photos are of the actual batch on sale.</p>

<h2>Smell</h2>
<p>Hawaiian Haze buds are more subtle in aroma than some other CBD strains. Not to distract from the delightful aroma you would expect. It is earthy, woodsy, fresh & piney with a hint of fruity sweetness.</p>

<h2>Taste</h2>

<p>Hawaiian Haze CBD flower tastes fresh and slightly tangy, isn’t overpowering, not too harsh on the throat and lungs when consumed. Similar to its aromatic characteristics, the taste is subtle but enjoyable. Earthy, a touch of cinnamon, with a finish of sweet fruits.</p>

<h2>Effects</h2>

<p>Hawaiian haze gets to work almost immediately after consumption, instant relief, and aches melt away. These Hawaiian Haze flowers have been a firm favorite at the dispensary. Reports that small amounts are uplifting, energetic, yet calming. More significant amounts seem popular for night-time with a full-body relaxing & mellowing for the perfect sleep aid.</p>
