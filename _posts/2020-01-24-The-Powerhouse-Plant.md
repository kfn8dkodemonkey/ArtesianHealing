<p>CBD is not only safe but is an extremely powerful plant for health and wellness. Studies from the World Health Organisation (WHO) reveal that CBD has no adverse health effects. Although CBD is the most noted molecular in hemp there are many others that can contribute to the plant making it a powerhouse of health and wellness.</p>

<h2>Hundreds of Cannabinoids</h2>
<p>With more than 120 other naturally occurring cannabinoids known to exist in the hemp plant, the potential for these other molecules as dietary supplement ingredients is nearly endless. In fact, the full range of cannabinoids has yet to be explored both scientifically and by consumers.</p>

<p>Most consumers have heard terms such as CBDa, CBG, CBC, CBGV, CBN, THC and THCv adding to the whole experience along with terpenes such as a-Pinene, Mycene, Limonene, and Caryophyllene just to name a few, as well as flavonoids, plant proteins, essential fatty acids, and other phytonutrients (which include polyphenols) that plants contain, also add to the overall character of the experience.</p>

<p>Phytocannabinoids & cannabinoids differ from endocannabinoids, how? Endo(meaning internal)cannabinoids are produced naturally by the body’s endocannabinoid system. Phyo(meaning plant)cannabinoids are produced in hemp/cannabis plants and interact with our endocannabinoid system. A phytocannabinoid is a naturally-occurring concentrated oil that is present in the resin that coats the leaves and flowers of the cannabis plant. Cannabinoids are predominantly present in the resin.</p>

<p>Don’t panic! We know this is a lot to take in and most of those new to CBD are still trying to grasp an understanding of the basic differences of full-spectrum vs broad spectrum. Cannabis/Hemp and cannabinoids is a complex and seemingly endless subject.</p>
