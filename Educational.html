<h2>Why buy our hemp flower?</h2>

<p>Artesian Healing is committed to providing you with honest, safe, clean, high-quality CBD hemp flower products you can trust!</p>

<p>We get organically-grown, premium quality hemp flower from indoor growers in the USA. All our flower is
slow cured with high CBD and low THC of less than 0.3% and is non-GMO. We offer only the best CBD flower avalible on the market with a veriaty of strains at the best price.</p>

<h2>What sets us apart, and why should you trust us?</h2>

<p>From day one, Artesian Healing ethos and our mission were to provide the best possible service, clean, safe, high-quality CBD products. Held to high
standards, with clear, transparent reporting and never cutting corners, or rushing out potentially unsafe, un-clean products for the sake of financial gain.
We chose our ethics over profit, which will never waiver.</p>

<p>Our smokable hemp flowers come from fully licensed specialist small batch hemp flower growers, who provide us with open access to their farms — spend
considerable time to forge relationships with us, in order to better understand their growing practices, their ethics and their standards align with ours.
We don't just work with anybody — we have very strict processes we carry out before entering into a partnership with hemp flower growers.</p>

<h2>How do we scrutinize hemp farms, and what's our inspection process?</h2>

<p>The first step in our partnership inspection process is understanding what each farm stands for, what their goals are, who the people are managing the
grow operations, to gauge whether or not we stand for the same objectives and standards.</p>

<p>We then look into their farm, hemp growing practices, their hemp growing operation procedures, their hemp flower turnover rates, curing process, handling,
storage, their licensing & legal documentation, and review the products' most recent available lab tests. We look for the hemp flowers cannabinoid profile,
THC content, contaminant tests, pesticides, and heavy metals. If the farm meets our requirements and the hemp flower lab tests are clean, we move to the first
sample testing stage.</p>

<p>We sample the final cured hemp flowers. We look for the quality of curing, trimming quality, process and standards, smell, feel, and overall bud quality.
Is it too young, was it rushed cured or dried, has it lost its distinctive aroma, is it too dry, to wet, to open?</p>

<p>We then request random samples of each hemp flower strain and send them away for testing to an independent 3rd party lab to confirm the initial reports
presented to us compares to the samples we test. If all comes back as expected, we then purchase the verified hemp flower strains.</p>

<p>Once we take delivery of the final cured hemp flowers, we take random samples from each batch, send that away to an independent 3rd party lab to establish
the product delivered is as expected. Displays the cannabinoid profile we procured and, most importantly: Clean, free from contamination, pesticides, heavy
metals, and molds.</p>

<p>If at any stage our hemp flower batch tests come back non-compliant or tainted in any way, that batch of flower buds would not go on sale, and our purchase
is returned to the grower.</p>

<p>We never cut corners; we never release hemp flower buds until we are 100% sure they meet our demanding standards, that our customers have come to expect.</p>

<p>As with all of our <a href="{{site.url}}/store">CBD products</a>, we publish the final product, batch-specific <a href="{{site.url}}/about/lab-reports/">3rd party reports</a>
on each product page for our customers to read and review.</p>
